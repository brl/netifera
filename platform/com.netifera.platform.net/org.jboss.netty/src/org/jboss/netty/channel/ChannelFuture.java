/**
 * The result of an asynchronous {@link Channel} I/O operation.
 * <p>
 * All I/O operations in Netty are asynchronous.  It means any I/O calls will
 * return immediately with no guarantee that the requested I/O operation has
 * been completed at the end of the call.  Instead, you will be returned with
 * a {@link ChannelFuture} instance which tells you when the requested I/O
 * operation has succeeded, failed, or cancelled.
 * <p>
 * Various methods are provided to let you check if the I/O operation has been
 * completed, wait for the completion, and retrieve the result of the I/O
 * operation. It also allows you to add more than one {@link ChannelFutureListener}
 * so you can get notified when the I/O operation has been completed.
 *
 * <h3>Prefer {@link #addListener(ChannelFutureListener)} to {@link #await()}</h3>
 *
 * It is recommended to prefer {@link #addListener(ChannelFutureListener)} to
 * {@link #await()} wherever possible to get notified when an I/O operation is
 * done and to do any follow-up tasks.
 * <p>
 * {@link #addListener(ChannelFutureListener)} is non-blocking.  It simply adds
 * the specified {@link ChannelFutureListener} to the {@link ChannelFuture}, and
 * I/O thread will notify the listeners when the I/O operation associated with
 * the future is done.  {@link ChannelFutureListener} yields the best
 * performance and resource utilization because it does not block at all, but
 * it could be tricky to implement a sequential logic if you are not used to
 * event-driven programming.
 * <p>
 * By contrast, {@link #await()} is a blocking operation.  Once called, the
 * caller thread blocks until the operation is done.  It is easier to implement
 * a sequential logic with {@link #await()}, but the caller thread blocks
 * unnecessarily until the I/O operation is done and there's relatively
 * expensive cost of inter-thread notification.  Moreover, there's a chance of
 * dead lock in a particular circumstance, which is described below.
 *
 * <h3>Do not call {@link #await()} inside {@link ChannelHandler}</h3>
 * <p>
 * The event handler methods in {@link ChannelHandler} is often called by
 * an I/O thread unless an {@link ExecutionHandler} is in the
 * {@link ChannelPipeline}.  If {@link #await()} is called by an event handler
 * method, which is called by the I/O thread, the I/O operation it is waiting
 * for might never be complete because {@link #await()} can block the I/O
 * operation it is waiting for, which is a dead lock.
 * <pre>
 * // BAD - NEVER DO THIS
 * public void messageReceived(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, MessageEvent e) {
 *     if (e.getMessage() instanceof GoodByeMessage) {
 *         ChannelFuture future = e.getChannel().close();
 *         future.awaitUninterruptibly();
 *         // Perform post-closure operation
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * // GOOD
 * public void messageReceived(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, MessageEvent e) {
 *     if (e.getMessage() instanceof GoodByeMessage) {
 *         ChannelFuture future = e.getChannel().close();
 *         future.addListener(new ChannelFutureListener() {
 *             public void operationComplete(ChannelFuture future) {
 *                 // Perform post-closure operation
 *                 // ...
 *             }
 *         });
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In spite of the disadvantages mentioned above, there are certainly the cases
 * where it is more convenient to call {@link #await()}. In such a case, please
 * make sure you do not call {@link #await()} in an I/O thread.  Otherwise,
 * {@link IllegalStateException} will be raised to prevent a dead lock.
